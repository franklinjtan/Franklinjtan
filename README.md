# [Project 1: Portfolio Diversification: Correlation Risk Management with Python](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Portfolio-Diversification-Correlation-Risk-Management-with-Python)
* Understanding the importance of diversification and a portfolio of uncorrelated returns, I plotted the 5-year returns of several equities, ETFs, and commodities against SPY. 
* I also used linear regression to calculate the beta and correlation, and generated a correlation matrix and a heatmap.<br>

# [Project 2: Subway Yelp Reviews Analysis](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Subway-Yelp-Reviews-Analysis)
* Created a set of analyses and data visualizations that support or disprove the following statements made by Subway Restaurant leadership:
  * Head of Customer Service: “Our ratings are gradually improving, and we will soon reach 4.5/5.”
  * Head of Store Operations: “Sandwiches are a tricky business. All sandwich chains suffer from poor customer ratings.”
  * Head of Social Media: “The goal of 4.5/5 is unreasonable for national chains like us. Only small, local, and boutique restaurants can achieve such high ratings.”
  * Chief Data Scientist: “It is well known that customers make the effort to give a rating only when they are either extremely angry or absolutely delighted with the service. So online ratings are not reliable.”
* Used matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and pandas to generate line charts, bar charts, scatterplots, groupedby dataframes, and linear regression<br>

# [Project 3: Monte Carlo Simulation - Optimal Production Level](https://github.com/franklinjtan/-Monte-Carlo-Simulation---Optimal-Production-Level-)
* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a production level recommendation given a set of parameters
* Used NumPy to generate a random sample of demand instances from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
* Used matplotlib to generate a scatterplot visualization with a color scale depicting optimal ranges of production

# [Project 4: Visualizing and Forecasting Monthly Retail Trade Data](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Visualizing-and-Forecasting-Monthly-Retail-Trade-Data)
* Cleaned and prepared monthly retail trade data from the Census Burea to create a time-series of various industries from 1992 to 2022
* Used Python Pandas for data cleaning and Tableau to create visualizations
* [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/franklin.tan/viz/StartupsFueleCommerceGrowth/Dashboard5)

# [Project 5: Fashion Store Crawler](https://github.com/franklinjtan/fashion-store-crawler)
* Created an application that crawls the a fashion store website and extracts product information to helps users track and reduce their environmental impact.
* Scraped over 1000 product descriptions from the clothing store, The Reformation using python and selenium
* Stored the data in a hosted database (AWS RDS).
* Optimized solution by targeting unique identifier-keys like ASIN in cases where website structure changes or product becomes out-of-stock.
